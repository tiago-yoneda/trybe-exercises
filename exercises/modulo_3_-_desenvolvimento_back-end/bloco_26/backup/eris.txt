### Appearance ###
Eris is a beautiful girl with long silvery hair and blue eyes. In the anime, she is depicted with purple eyes and silver hair with a violet tint to it and portrayed as a slightly older girl. She possesses the physical appearance of a fifteen years-old girl and is stated to be extremely beautiful by many people including Kazuma, and her peers describe her as having a delicate and beautiful face that impresses on them a hint of melancholy. Eris has long silver hair going down to her ankles which has a light purple ombre. She has two long bangs which reach down to her shoulders and an ahoge sprouting from her fringe.

Eris usually wears a purple coif on her head which matches the shade of her purple eyes, as well as a matching white and purple one-piece hagoromo dress with yellow trimmings which goes slightly passed her knees. She also wears purple shoes and white stockings, as well as a necklace with a pink diamond-shaped jewel in its center. She is not very buxom when it comes to the chest area, and as such she usually wears breast pads in an attempt to imitate having more favorable assets

Her appearance as Chris is very similar to her real identity. She is a teenage girl with a light complexion and purple eyes. She has short silver hair and a light purple ombre of a sort. Her hair is longer at the front of which she has two strands of hair framing her face with a piece of hair pointing out from her fringe. She wears earrings and has a small scar on her right cheek. Most likely due to her tomboyish and outgoing nature, along with her flat chest and short hair, she is often mistaken for a boy. Instead of covering up her scar like she does as Eris, Chris leaves her deep-cut entirely visible.

Chris usually wears a fairly revealing outfit, an attire common among females of the rogue class. Her outfit consists of a light blue scarf, a short green cape which goes down to her elbows, a pair of black elbow gloves with normal brown gloves layered over them, short blue jean-shorts, white knee-high socks with a blue trimming, brown boots, and a bikini-like grey top. Ever since her first run-in with Kazuma, Chris has worn black leggings in case her panties are stolen again. She also wears diamond-shaped blue earrings and usually has an enchanted dagger fastened to waist at the back.

### Personality ###
Eris is a very kind and gentle girl who treats others with kindness and respect. She is also very caring and she always interests her adherents. She has a very cheerful attitude, but she can sometimes act a bit childish. She is insecure about her breast size and uses breast pads to compensate. Aqua often embarrasses her with this knowledge, as Eris wants as few people as possible to notice her lack in bust. As a result of her kind-hearted and gentle nature, her scent is noted to be very fragrant.

While disguised as Chris, she displays an even more cheerful and energetic demeanor that is almost always seen with a big smile and boasting a bright personality. Though befitting her role as a thief, she sometimes acts quite childish and mischievous when around the prospects of treasure.
